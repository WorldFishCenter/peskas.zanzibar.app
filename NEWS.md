# peskas.dashboard 1.4.0

## Security

- **User management endpoints were unauthenticated beyond "is logged in"**: `user.delete`
  and `user.upsert` ran on `protectedProcedure` with no permission check — the delete
  handler's only guard was that a session carried an email, under a comment claiming it
  verified admin privileges. Any signed-in user could delete or modify any account,
  including changing their own group. Both now call `assertPermission()`. Existing
  administrators are unaffected: the "Manage users" menu entry was already gated on a
  stricter check (all of create/read/update/delete), so anyone who could see the link
  passes the narrower server-side checks.

- **File uploads accepted anonymous requests**: `/api/uploadthing` shipped the template's
  placeholder `const auth = (req) => ({ id: 'fakeId' })`, so both upload routes — including
  one accepting 256 MB video — were open to the public internet against the deployment's
  storage quota. The middleware now requires a NextAuth session.

- **Deactivated accounts could still sign in**: the `status === "inactive"` check sat after
  the successful-password `return` in the credentials provider, so it never ran for a valid
  password. It only fired on a *wrong* password, where it also leaked account status to an
  unauthenticated caller. The check now runs before the password is compared.

- **Single permission implementation**: `hasPermission()` moved from
  `apps/isomorphic-i18n/src/helpers/auth.ts` into `packages/api/src/lib/permissions.ts`, so
  the tRPC procedures and the UI read the same function. Previously only the UI had one,
  which is how the menu and the API came to disagree.

## Bug Fixes

- **Password reset emails linked to a different application**: the reset link hardcoded
  `https://peskas-next-umber.vercel.app` whenever `NODE_ENV === 'production'`, sending every
  country's users to an unrelated deployment. The base URL is now derived from
  `NEXTAUTH_URL`, falling back to `VERCEL_URL`, so each deployment links to itself.

- **Passwords were hashed twice**: `user.upsert` set `password` twice in one object literal —
  a cost-12 hash that was immediately overwritten by a cost-10 `hashSync`. The cost-12 work
  was computed and discarded, and the stored hash was the weaker one. Now hashed once at
  cost 12, and only when a password was actually supplied.

- **Social previews advertised the template**: `metaObject()` still returned
  `"Isomorphic Furyroad"` as the OpenGraph title suffix and site name, pointed `url` at
  `isomorphic-furyroad.vercel.app`, and served the template's banner from RedQ's S3 bucket.
  It now derives everything from `activeCountry`, so each country's link previews carry its
  own title, description, and locale.

- **`user.byId` crashed for users with no group**: `user?.groups[0].name` threw a TypeError
  once optional chaining short-circuited past the array index. Now `user?.groups?.[0]?.name`.

- **Middleware matched locales that do not exist**: the matcher listed `de|es|ar|he|zh`
  alongside the three real locales, routing requests for languages with no translation
  files. Trimmed to `en|sw|pt`.

- **`ask-data` page title hardcoded Zanzibar**: read `"Ask Data | Peskas Zanzibar"` on every
  deployment; now goes through `metaObject()`.

## Removed

- **Two unused applications**: `apps/isomorphic` and `apps/isomorphic-starter` were template
  variants with no deployment from this repository — confirmed against Vercel, where all
  three live projects (`peskas-dashboard-{zanzibar,kenya,mozambique}`) build
  `apps/isomorphic-i18n`. `apps/isomorphic` continues to exist in the separate `peskas-next`
  repository, so nothing is lost.

- **Cross-package imports reaching into a deleted app**: `packages/isomorphic-core` imported
  *upward* into `apps/isomorphic` from three files via relative paths. Two of them were
  reachable from the deployed app, so deleting the app without severing these first would
  have broken the build. `utils/uploadthing.ts` now takes its `OurFileRouter` type from the
  surviving app; `get-status-badge.tsx` and `product-classic-card.tsx` were themselves dead
  and were removed.

- **Four template layouts**: Carbon, Beryllium, Helium, and Boron still carried the
  boilerplate's navigation (File Manager, Widgets, Newsletter) and were reachable through
  the settings drawer, giving users a route into template pages. `LAYOUT_OPTIONS` is now
  `HYDROGEN` and `LITHIUM` only. Note that Lithium — not Hydrogen — has always been the
  default that users see, despite the route group being named `(hydrogen)`; a stale
  `isomorphic-layout` value in `localStorage` now falls back to Lithium.

- **Template routes**: `/groups/*` (five stubs rendering literal strings like "AIA"),
  `/auth/sign-in-1..5` and `/auth/sign-up-1..5`, `/widgets/cards`, `/widgets/charts`,
  `/forms/newsletter`, `/file` (an exact duplicate of the home page), and the
  `profile-settings` sub-pages for team, billing, integration, and password.

- **1,415 files, roughly 140,000 lines** in total, including 357 files that only became
  unreachable once the above were gone. Source files under `apps/` and `packages/` dropped
  from 754 to 320. Dead code was identified with an import-reachability walk from the real
  Next.js entry points, checked against runtime `import()` references rather than static
  imports alone — the icon set in `isomorphic-core`, for example, was kept alive solely by a
  template gallery page loading `./icons/${fileName}` at runtime.

- **`tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` untracked**: a 2.2 MB TypeScript build artifact was committed to
  the repository. Added to `.gitignore`.

## Improvements

- **Catch and revenue charts share one implementation**: `catch-time-series` /
  `revenue-time-series` and `catch-radar` / `revenue-radar` were near-identical copies that
  had drifted apart — the catch charts had responsive mobile margins but formatted tooltip
  values with a raw `toFixed(2)`, while the revenue charts ran values through
  `formatDashboardNumber()` and formatted their axes but ignored mobile viewports. They are
  now `metric-time-series` and `metric-radar`, parameterised by the metric the page passes
  in, keeping the better behaviour from each. Shared loading, error, empty, tooltip, and
  legend-toggle logic moved to `charts/chart-common.tsx`. The `/revenue` route bundle fell
  from 5.97 kB to 649 B as a result.

- **Mail service tidied**: removed the `inviteProvider` template — declared but with no
  `.hbs` file, so any use would have thrown — along with its "Please sign up for Rheumote
  Control" subject line and a hardcoded `declan@mountaindev.com` address, both leftovers
  from an unrelated product. `prepTemplate()` and `getTemplate()` no longer duplicate the
  same read-and-cache block. Deleted the unreferenced `resetPasswordAdmin.hbs`.

- **Root layout and tRPC context**: the root layout imported five modules it never used
  (its body is just `return children`). `createTRPCContext` computed `ip` as
  `xForwardedFor ?? xRealIp` where the left operand had already been defaulted to
  `"unknown"`, making the fallback unreachable; it also read an `x-global-filters` header
  that was never used.

- **Documentation**: `CLAUDE.md` updated to describe the single application, the two
  remaining layouts, and the correct dashboard source path.

## Analytics

- **Per-country Google Analytics**: The GA4 measurement ID is now read from
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` per deployment instead of being hardcoded, so each
  country domain reports into its own GA4 property. An optional `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ROLLUP_ID`,
  set to the same value on every deployment, mirrors events into a shared property for a
  platform-wide view. Both are declared in `turbo.json` — without that, Turborepo could
  reuse one country's cached build for another and ship the wrong measurement ID.

- **Country dimension on every event**: `peskas_country` and `peskas_country_code` are
  attached globally via `gtag('set')` before `gtag('config')`, so even a shared property can
  be broken down by country. Both must be registered as event-scoped custom dimensions in
  GA4, which does not backfill them.

- **Fixed double-counted page views**: The analytics component re-fired `gtag('config')` on
  every route change while GA4 enhanced measurement was already tracking History API
  navigations, counting each client-side navigation twice. Page views are now left to
  enhanced measurement alone. Historical page-view figures are inflated.

- **Analytics component is now a Server Component**: Dropping the `usePathname()` /
  `useSearchParams()` hooks also removed an unrelated problem — `useSearchParams()` in the
  root layout with no `<Suspense>` boundary opted statically generated pages into
  client-side rendering.

- **Custom event tracking**: Five events cover the filter and map controls:
  `filter_time_range_change`, `filter_metric_change`, `filter_district_change`,
  `map_basemap_change`, and `map_effort_range_toggle`. They fire through a typed
  `trackEvent()` helper in `src/lib/analytics.ts` that no-ops when no measurement ID is set.
  Events are suppressed when a control is re-set to its current value, and nothing fires on
  mount, hydration, or route-driven state resets.

- **Analytics documentation**: New `apps/isomorphic-i18n/ANALYTICS.md` covers the GA4
  account structure options, required admin setup, the event and parameter reference, and
  verification steps. `COUNTRY_SETUP.md` now includes the analytics step when adding a
  country.

# peskas.dashboard 1.3.0

## Infrastructure

- **Multi-country deployment**: Each country (TZ, KE, MZ) deploys as a separate Vercel project
  from the same repository, with `NEXT_PUBLIC_COUNTRY_CODE` and `MONGODB_URI` as the only
  per-project env vars. `MONGODB_URI_COASTS` is shared across all deployments.

- **Fixed `NEXT_PUBLIC_COUNTRY_CODE`**: Renamed env var from `COUNTRY_CODE` to
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_COUNTRY_CODE`. The previous name was `undefined` in all client components
  (Next.js only exposes `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars to the browser bundle), causing the app to
  always fall back to Zanzibar regardless of which country was configured.

- **`gaul2-districts.ts` registry pattern**: Refactored `packages/nosql/src/constants/gaul2-districts.ts`
  to use the same three-country registry pattern as `countryConfig.ts`. Previously only Zanzibar
  data was exported; Kenya and Mozambique were commented out, breaking the district-summary
  API router for those countries.

- **Project renamed**: Project renamed from `peskas.zanzibar.v2` to `peskas.dashboard` to
  reflect its multi-country scope.

# peskas.dashboard 1.2.0

## New Features

- **GAUL2 choropleth map**: Homepage map now overlays administrative district boundaries
  colour-coded by the currently selected metric (CPUE, RPUE, catch tonnage, estimated
  revenue, or submission count). Boundaries are fetched from a separate portal MongoDB
  database (`wio_gaul2` collection) via a new `MONGODB_URI_COASTS` environment variable.
  Colour scale uses a 6-stop sequential Blues palette linearly interpolated across the
  district value range; districts with no data render in grey. The choropleth reacts in
  real-time to both the metric dropdown and the time range selector.

- **Choropleth tooltip**: Hovering a district polygon on the homepage map shows the
  district name and the selected metric value, formatted with the active locale.

- **Choropleth legend**: The map info panel displays the metric label and a colour ramp
  with min/max values when boundary data is loaded.

## Improvements

- **Shared metric state**: `district-summary-bar.tsx` metric selection is now driven by
  the shared `selectedMetricAtom` (Jotai) instead of local `useState`. The bar chart
  and the choropleth map always reflect the same metric selection.

- **Shared date range utility**: Extracted `computeDateRange()` into `dashboard/utils.ts`.
  Both the district summary bar and the choropleth map use it, eliminating duplicated
  inline date computation.

- **Multi-country boundaries**: `countryConfig.ts` extended with an `iso3Code` field
  (`'TZA'` / `'KEN'` / `'MOZ'`). The choropleth queries boundaries for the active
  country automatically — no code change needed when switching deployments.

- **New tRPC router**: `gaul2Boundaries.getByCountry` — queries `wio_gaul2` across all
  known field name variants (alpha-2 and alpha-3 ISO codes, `iso3_code` / `country` /
  nested `properties.*` fields) with a JS-filter fallback for non-standard documents.
  Returns a standard GeoJSON `FeatureCollection`.

- **Isolated portal DB connection**: `packages/nosql/src/portal-db.ts` manages a
  separate Mongoose connection (`mongoose.createConnection()`) for the portal database,
  fully isolated from the main fisheries DB connection.

# peskas.dashboard 1.1.0

## Improvements

- **Navigation**: Removed template artifacts (Groups, Widgets menus; ~130 dead route definitions).
  Routes trimmed to fisheries-only (`catch`, `revenue`, `catch_composition`, `map`, `ask_data`,
  `about`, `settings`, `forms.*`). Duplicate `nav-charts` bug fixed.

- **Dashboard components**: Deleted 23 dead component files (0 imports each). Renamed remaining
  components to kebab-case with descriptive names: `metric-cards`, `district-summary-bar`,
  `district-metrics-table`. `index.tsx` cleaned of dead imports and commented-out code.

- **Type safety**: `MetricBarCard` props fully typed (`MetricConfigEntry`, `MetricDataPoint`,
  `MonthlyRegionData`); removed `any` annotations. Badge configuration moved to `DropdownItemType`
  (`badge?: 'beta' | 'soon'`) instead of fragile string-key checks.

- **i18n**: Added `text-district-metrics`, `text-coming-soon`, `text-feature-under-development`
  keys in both English and Swahili. Nav keys (`nav-settings`, `nav-catch-overview`) aligned.
  New `ComingSoonPlaceholder` client component for placeholder pages.

- **Code quality**: `'use client'` directives made explicit; `lang!` assertions replaced with
  `lang ?? 'en'` throughout; unused imports removed.

# peskas.dashboard 1.0.0

## Major Changes

- **Multi-country dashboard**: Internationalized Next.js dashboard (apps/isomorphic-i18n)
  for Peskas fisheries deployments. Country is selected via `COUNTRY_CODE` at build
  time; each deployment uses its own config in `countryConfig.ts` and MongoDB,
  with no code fork required.

- **Unified time range for charts**: Navbar time range selector drives all time-based
  charts. Radar (catch and revenue seasonality) now use the same time range as time
  series and treemaps instead of a hardcoded year.

## Improvements

- **Navigation**: Ask Data, Settings, and Map entries can be hidden from nav and
  search (Hydrogen, Lithium, Boron layouts and page-links) for country-specific
  deployments.

- **API**: `monthlySummary.radarData` accepts a `months` parameter (date range)
  instead of a single `year`, returning an array of month-labeled points for the
  selected range. Month labels include the year when the range spans two years.

- **Documentation**: Added `COUNTRY_SETUP.md` for adding a new country to the
  dashboard (config, env, locales, deploy).

## Bug Fixes

- None in this release.
